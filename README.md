# Responsive-Portfolio
This is one of the two assignments from week two. This assignment focused on alternating the display of our website on devices using media queries. The assignment suggests us use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

#Technology Used

Student has to open the previous homework html and css. For media queries, student works on CSS page to add a certain screen size for the website to be able to run laptop, iPad, or phone.

#Thoughts

The process is easy however student encounters a problem during the assignment. When students decrease the screen to 640px, the logo doesn't want to align to the center instead it stays on top left corner. So students has to alternate some code on the CSS such as; position to static and text-align to center. Student has to add some margin for the (nav a) elements as well. Student also adds a new background color for each screen size.
